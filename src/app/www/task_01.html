<h2>How do we know if chicken feed is making our chickens bigger?</h2>

<h2 id="anchor1">Background</h2>

  Before you begin the following module, you should have already studied
  basic hypothesis testing. You should be familiar with the concept of a
  null and alternative hypthosis.  You will not need to compute a 
  power calculation directly for the AP exam, but the following exploration
  will help you to better understand how to use a power curve, and interpert
  the meaning of power.

<h3>Task 1: Analysis</h1>

<p>
    Working with your partner(s), investigate whether the various chicken feed 
    brands have any effect on the growth of chickens.
</p>
 
<p>
  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/chicken" target="_blank">Research has shown</a> that chickens are usually around 27.6 inches tall and weigh approximately 2.6 kg (5.7 pounds) on average. However, various chicken feed producers have made bold claims that their brand of chicken feed can help you grow even larger chickens! We need to setup some experiments to test those claims, and help farmer Billy decide whether or not it is worth the added expense to switch from his current chicken feed to one of these more expensive brands.
</p>

<p>
  Assume that Farmer Billy is currently feeding his chickens with <b>Old McDonald's Favorite Feed</b>. Compare this feed to others and then answer
  the questions below.
