# CS6460
OMSCS - CS6460 Education Technology - Fall 2023 Semester

Created by Jeffery Painter as part of the deliverables for the CS-6460 
Education Technology course created by Professor Joyner at Georgia Tech.

# Description
This project focused on building a framework to support educators wishing to use the R Shiny
framework for developing interactive simulations targeted at high school students taking
a course in statistics. The project is exemplified by a new lesson developed around the
exploration of statistical power, Type I and Type II error rates.

The framework supports user authentication, separation of roles and responsibilities for
administrators, teachers and students. It provides a basic dashboard for teachers to 
evaluate student performance and allows for a deep dive into individual student assessments.
